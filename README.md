# CalculateSoilProperties_at_NEON_sites
This script calculate soil properties (e.g, hydraulic conductivity, field capacity, wilting point, etc.) based on sand-silt-clay fraction and bulk density of the soil pits at multiple depths.

Necessary data to run the complete script is being provided.

script 'pedotransfer.R' is adopted from https://github.com/mrke/NicheMapR

Outputs from the script were validated carefully.
